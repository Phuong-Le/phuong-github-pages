Source code for Phuong's personal page

Made with [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)

Useful resources for writing a web page (that I used a lot in writing this repo)

- [Web basics](https://careerfoundry.com/en/tutorials/web-development-for-beginners/introduction-to-web-development/)
- [Eleventy short tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKdQEXqfFA0): super clear, easy to follow along but structuring of sample project might not be what you want
- [Eleventy long tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZyNBd1WgVM): nice project with source code provided (although doesn't go into details how eleventy works as the short tutorial)
