I'm a PhD student at the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/) and [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). Previously, I was an undergraduate at the [Australian National University](https://www.anu.edu.au/). Before that, I spent my first ~20 years in Viet Nam with my parents, my little sister and our old grumpy cat.

I'm enjoying my journey learning bioinformatics - an interdisciplinary field that uses statistics and computing to solve biological questions.
