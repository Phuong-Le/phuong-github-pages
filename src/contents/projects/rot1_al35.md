title: "Cancer Genomics: How do the patterns of mutations vary in different countries?"
---

This is my first rotation at the Sanger institute, under the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/cancer-ageing-and-somatic-mutation/">Cancer, Aging and Somatic Mutations</a> programme. I was part of the <a href="https://www.mutographs.org/">Mutographs</a> team and supervised by Mike Stratton and Sarah Moody.

During the 11 weeks with Mutographs, I looked at the geographical differences in mutation patterns in different cancers. 

## Software

R packages I wrote for use in this rotation

- <a href="https://github.com/Phuong-Le/mutationsR">MutationsR</a>: works with mutations data in R, especially string representations of mutations.
- <a href="https://github.com/Phuong-Le/UnsupLearnR">UnsupLearnR</a>: what a weird name, but it's a helper for unsupervised learning analyses like PCA and K-means (Most likely I will continue developing and maintaining it in the future)
- <a href="https://github.com/Phuong-Le/graphicsPLr">graphicsPLr</a>: colour and shaped pickers when you're particularly lazy about choosing colours...
