title: "Cancer Genomics: How do the patterns of mutations vary in different countries?"
---

This is my first rotation at the Sanger institute, under the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/cancer-ageing-and-somatic-mutation/">Cancer, Aging and Somatic Mutations</a> programme. I was part of the <a href="https://www.mutographs.org/">Mutographs</a> team and supervised by Mike Stratton and Sarah Moody.

Our cells are exposed to many mutagens - some are extrinsic, such as UV light and tobacco smoke while some are intrinsic, like APOBEC, a substance our B cells use to mutate itself (to deal with pathogens). These mutagens could leave distinctive patterns on our mutation profiles - check out [the COSMIC mutational signatures](https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/signatures/). This is particularly obvious in the context of cancer. During the 11 weeks with Mutographs, I looked at the geographical differences in mutation patterns in different cancers. 

## Software

R packages I wrote for use in this rotation

- [MutationsR](https://github.com/Phuong-Le/mutationsR): works with mutations data in R, especially string representations of mutations.
- [UnsupLearnR](https://github.com/Phuong-Le/UnsupLearnR): what a weird name, but it's a helper for unsupervised learning analyses like PCA and K-means (Most likely I will continue developing and maintaining it in the future)
- [graphicsPLr](https://github.com/Phuong-Le/graphicsPLr): colour and shaped pickers when you're particularly lazy about choosing colours...


## Results

Stay tuned for updates on the results
