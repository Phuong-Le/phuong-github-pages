  <main>
    <p>I wrote my first ever thesis when I did my Honours at the Australian National University. After writing the thesis, I decided to extract the LaTeX code into a separate template so I (and who knows, maybe you) could use in the future.</p>
<h3>What's involved?</h3>
<p>Personally, I find it pretty (although I could be biased). Besides being pretty, the code that I wrote was very simple and easy to tweak (again, I could be biased). I tried to make it as straightforward to edit as possible because when it comes to a thesis, everyone has their own opinion on little details...</p>
<p>In the content of the template, I also put down some LaTeX tips (helpful for beginners) and some writing tips. Some of the writing tips were from my own experience, and some I got by hassling my friend Soraya Zwahlen.</p>
<p>So, please check out <a href="https://github.com/Phuong-Le/thesis_template/tree/main">my pretty thesis</a>!</p>
